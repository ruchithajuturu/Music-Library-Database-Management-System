# Music-Library-Database-Management-System
This project is a comprehensive Music Library Database Management System designed to organize, manage, and query large collections of music data. The system leverages the strengths of both SQL and NoSQL databases to handle structured and unstructured data efficiently, providing robust solutions for music storage, retrieval, and analysis.

# Technologies Used:
SQL: Used for structured data storage, ensuring robust relational database management.
NoSQL (MongoDB): Handles unstructured and semi-structured data for scalability and flexibility.
Python: For database interaction, data processing, and application development.
Flask/Django: (Optional) Frameworks for building a user-friendly interface to interact with the database.
Data Visualization Tools: For presenting insights derived from the music library.

# Key Features:
Music Library Management:
Store and manage metadata such as song titles, artists, albums, genres, and release dates.
Handle relationships between entities like artists and albums using SQL.
Search and Retrieval:
Implement complex queries to fetch data based on specific criteria (e.g., all songs from a particular genre or artist).
Use MongoDB for flexible and schema-less queries for unstructured data like lyrics or user playlists.
Data Analytics:
Perform data analysis to uncover insights, such as the most popular genres or artists over time.
Scalability:
Utilize the strengths of NoSQL to store large volumes of user-generated data, like playlists or user preferences.
Optional Front-End:
(If applicable) Develop a web-based interface for users to interact with the music library.

# Set up the database:
For SQL: Use the provided .sql scripts to create and populate the database.
For NoSQL: Import the sample datasets using the provided MongoDB scripts.
(Optional) Launch the application:
Run the Flask/Django app to interact with the database through a user-friendly interface.

# Technologies and Skills:
Database Management: Proficiency in SQL for relational databases and MongoDB for NoSQL databases.
Python Scripting: For interacting with databases and performing data analytics.
Data Modeling: Efficient design of relational and non-relational schemas for music data.
Query Optimization: Writing optimized queries to handle large datasets.
